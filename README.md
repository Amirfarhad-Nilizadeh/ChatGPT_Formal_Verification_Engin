This paper explores the potential of leveraging ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, as a formal verification engine. We evaluate its effectiveness by feeding it Java programs along with their Java Modeling Language (JML) specifications, aiming to assess its proficiency in verifying program correctness and generating counterexamples. Our analysis involves 244 programs from the Java+JML dataset, including both correct and buggy versions. The findings reveal two critical aspects: 1) ChatGPT shows considerable potential in verifying the correctness of programs despite certain limitations, and 2) it accurately identifies all buggy programs in our dataset, efficiently providing suitable counterexamples.
